Eye tracing has a wide area of applications such as sports and psychology. To analyze gaze direction from a eye-tracking system for sports, software is needed that can display the gaze position on a video playback. Each gaze point needs to be synchronized with the video. 

The target for this project was to develop such a software that can be expanded later but is feature complete so that it can be used for analyzing footage and gaze data.
