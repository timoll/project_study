\label{chap:conclusions}

The Software that was developed during this project fulfills all must requirements. Additionally the functionality to play overlays was also implemented and the performance of the video decoding and converting was evaluated. 

With the developed software it is now possible to analyze where someone is looking if all needed information is available. 

There was not much time to test the software extensively so it probably has a fair amount of bugs. GazelleView is still missing many features that a up to day video player has such as fullscreen or audio support.
